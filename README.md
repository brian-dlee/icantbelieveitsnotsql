# I can't believe it's not SQL

Create code for any target application language from SQL. Inspired by sqlc, but
designed to be the thinnest possible layer between SQL and a desired programming
language. Write SQL files directly, and construct callable code with zero dependencies.
Well zero dependences is the goal, but initially there may be some dependency on database
drivers.
